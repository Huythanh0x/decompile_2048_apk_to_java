Need to take action "Deobfuscate" to get the `R.java`

### Error with Gradle build fro newly exported project 
> AndroidStudio automatically assign gradle version to default "8.9.0".

1. Update gradle version seems take effect.
2. Then I need to update java version in gradle build to 1.8
**Bonus**: add `gradle.properties` file to define some extra configuration for gradle build.
